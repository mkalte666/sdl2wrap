// just here is the first distinction!
// there are two headers - sdl2.h and sdl2stl.h
// sdl2stl.h enables functionality with the stl - mostly std::string and similar containers
// the stl is not required to get sdl2wrap working however
// also, instead of including sdl2sl.h, you could also define SDL2WRAP_USE_STL before including sdl2.h!
// anyway, here we go!
