# SDL2 C++ Wrapper
sdl2wrap is a c++17 wrapper around SDL2 (https://www.libsdl.org/)

### Design Goals
I created this to be used in personal projects. 
 * Exception-free error handling
 * Typesafe wrapping of flags, sdl types, ...
 * C++ features (RAII, class-based ownership modeling for pointer types, ...)
 * Do not use the stl. 
 
### Completion
Completion is work in progress.
